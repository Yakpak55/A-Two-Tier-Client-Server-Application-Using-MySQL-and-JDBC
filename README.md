# A-Two-Tier-Client-Server-Application-Using-MySQL-and-JDBC
 Developed two Java-based GUI applications to interact with a MySQL database using JDBC. 

The project involved:

● Client-Side Application: Created a user interface that allowed users to execute SQL commands against various databases. The interface included dropdown lists for selecting properties files, input fields for database credentials, and buttons for connection management and command execution.

● Specialized Accountant Interface: Developed a specialized GUI for an accountant user to query the operations log database, with hardcoded properties files and limited privileges to ensure security.

● Transaction Logging: Implemented a background transaction logging mechanism that kept track of all user interactions with the database. Flagged transactions were recorded in a separate log for auditing purposes.

● Error Handling and Metadata: Ensured proper error handling and displayed metadata for all query results. Any mismatches in user credentials resulted in appropriate error messages displayed in the GUI.

● Execution and Verification: Conducted comprehensive testing with multiple users and provided a complete set of labeled screenshots demonstrating the application's functionality.
